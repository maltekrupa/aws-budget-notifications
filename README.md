# aws-budget-notifications

AWS Lambda function posts billing updates to your Slack channel. Built for Python3.6

## Requirements

Create a Slack API application with an incoming webhook.

Trigger the function with a CloudWatch event set to your desired interval. For example, you could set the schedule to "rate(7 days)" to get a billing update in Slack once per week.

Give the Lambda function read-only access to your billing info.
